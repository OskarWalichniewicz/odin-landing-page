# odin-landing-page

This is implementation of exercise [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this exercise is to practice **CSS** and **HTML** elements taught so far.

I'll also put emphasis on gaining experience using **Git**, eg.:
- Creating and cloning repository,
- committing and pushing,
- writing [good commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/),
- trying [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/) in practice.
