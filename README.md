This is implementation of exercise [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this exercise is to practice **CSS** and **HTML** elements taught so far.

I'll also put emphasis on gaining experience using **Git**.
